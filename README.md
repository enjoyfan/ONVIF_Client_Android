# ONVIF_Client_Android
This project implements ONVIF on Android, including getDevice, authentication, streaming, recording and playback functions.
Besides, I also use some projects such as VXG_Player to implement streaming function, which can lower streaming delay.

However, I know some code should be fixed. If you guys meet some problems, let me know and I'll solve it as soon as possible.

P.S. This is my first time to use GitHub, so I need you guys' advice. Thanks!
